# Market-Segmentation
Find market segments in social network data of Facebook users.
Data consisted of users as nodes and their relationship between friends as their edges. 
The algorithm detected communities in attributed graph data based on the structural, demographic (age, sex, ethnicity, education) and attribute similarities using Python's iGraph module. 
The found segments are evaluated via influence propagation. 
In influence propagation an entity in the segment is influenced and how fast the influence propagates over the entire network is evaluated. 
The faster the influence propagates, the better is the segment.
